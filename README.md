# Counter

A simple Godot-based screen counter with keyboard input via a Python helper script.

---

## Requirements

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [`pynput`](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) library

Install `pynput` via pip:

```bash
pip install pynput
```

---

## Usage

1. **Launch the app** (`App.exe`).
2. When the counter window is focused:
   - Press the **arrow keys** to move the window.
   - **Right-click** on the window to access the options menu.

3. The Python script listens for key presses and sends them to the Godot app via UDP.
   - Press **`+`** to increment the counter.
   - Press **`-`** to decrement the counter.

## Project Structure

```
/project
├── App.exe
└── files
    ├── inputs_handler.py   # Python script that handles '+' and '-' key input
    └── conf.cfg            # Configuration file generated by the app (window pos, last value)
```

---

## Notes

- The Python script is launched by the Godot app on startup.
- Pyhton script (`inputs_handler.py`) can be edited to change keys.
- Make sure no firewall blocks UDP communication on the configured port (default: `9090`).
